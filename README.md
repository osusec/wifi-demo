# Disclaimer
Do not run this on campus without having spoken with the Information Security Office! Use of these tools can result in an [Acceptable Use Policy](https://policy.oregonstate.edu/UPSM/08-005_acceptable_use_computing_resources) violation (which is bad).

There are plaintext passwords in this file and in the Ansible files. This is not good! Don't use this for any test or production system, these VMs are isolated and only in existence for a short period of time for the demo.

# Infrastructure Setup

## Setup Instructions
1. Setup the VMs as shown below using VBox or VMware
2. Install sshpass
   - Should be in your repos
   - Mac: `brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kadwanev/bigboybrew/master/Library/Formula/sshpass.rb`
   - Debian/Ubuntu and its derivatives: `sudo apt install sshpass`
   - RedHat/CentOS: `yum install sshpass`
   - Windows: You can't use `sshpass` on Windows
3. Update the host vars file with the appropriate MAC addresses (TBD)
4. Make sure it all works: `ansible -i hosts all -m ping`
5. Run the Ansible playbook: `ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml`

## Physical Systems
 - Control System (not shown to attendee)
   - Can be virtualized if host system is running Windows (Ansible control system can't be run on Windows).
 - Attacker System
 - Victim System

Attacker VM has to be on the Attacker System, Victim VM has to be on Victim System, and the other two VMs can be on either of those systems. The Control System is not used to run VMs, only for orchestration via the wired network.

## Virtual Machines
This demo requires 4 VMs.

Base VM config (unless otherwise noted):
